# AudioCascade Privacy Policy

*Last updated: January 2025*

## Overview

AudioCascade ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how AudioCascade handles your information.

## Information Collection and Use

**AudioCascade does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information.**

The app operates entirely on your device and does not communicate with any external servers.

## Data Storage

All app preferences and settings are stored locally on your device using macOS's standard UserDefaults system. This includes:

- Device priorities and preferences
- App settings (start at login, check intervals, etc.)
- Device history (names and identifiers of audio devices)

This data never leaves your device and is not accessible to us or any third parties.

## Audio Device Access

AudioCascade requires access to your Mac's audio system to:
- Detect connected audio devices
- Switch between audio devices
- Monitor device connections

This access is used solely for the app's core functionality and no audio is recorded or transmitted.

## Third-Party Services

AudioCascade does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

## Updates

The app uses Sparkle framework for optional update checking. This only checks for new versions and can be disabled in the app settings. No personal information is transmitted during update checks.

## Data Security

Since AudioCascade doesn't collect any data, there is no risk of your personal information being compromised through our app.

## Children's Privacy

AudioCascade does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under the age of 13.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last updated" date above.
